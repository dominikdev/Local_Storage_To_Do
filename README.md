Local Storage To Do List
==============
This is a simple to do list app that I put together. It utilizes the local storage in your browser to save list and list item data so information is not lost when you navigate away from the page. I used Bootstrap to create the simple and clean design. It also utilizes the Bootstrap responsive framework to make it display properly across all devices.

Features
--------------

**Multiple Lists**

The app starts with a default list: "To Do". The title of this list is editable and you can also add as many other lists as you would like. If you delete all of the lists the default "To Do" will automatically become your default list.

**Saves Instantly**

The application data automatically saves after any changes to lists or list items. This ensures that no data is lost even if you navigate away from the page by mistake. As long as you don't clear your browser storage, your data will remain.

**Fully Responsive**

The application utilizes the responsive framework that Bootstrap provides to ensure it displays properly across all devices. On mobile devices the layout changes slightly, but all of the information and features still remain.


Database Storage
--------------
I also took the framework of this application and modified it to use database storage. This requires you create an account, but it allows you to access your data across multiple devices. Take a look at the application or the code below.
